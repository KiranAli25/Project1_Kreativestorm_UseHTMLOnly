                <h2>Overview</h2>
                <p>
                    <em>Anna Karenina</em> is widely regarded as one of the greatest novels of all time, written by Russian author <strong>Leo Tolstoy</strong> and published in <strong>1877</strong>. The novel explores the complexities of <strong>love, infidelity, family, and society</strong> in 19th-century Russia. It follows two parallel stories: the tragic love affair between the aristocratic <em>Anna Karenina</em> and the dashing <em>Count Alexei Vronsky</em>, and the contrastingly stable, yet philosophically complex, relationship between Konstantin Levin and Kitty Shcherbatsky.

                <h2>Plot Summary</h2>
                <p>The novel begins with Anna, a beautiful and intelligent woman, living a relatively comfortable but passionless life with her husband, Alexei Alexandrovich Karenin, a high-ranking government official. She meets Count Vronsky, a charming and handsome officer, and despite her marriage, the two fall into a passionate affair. This relationship shakes the foundation of Anna’s life, leading her to abandon her husband and son for Vronsky.</p>
                <p>As Anna’s love for Vronsky deepens, societal pressures and her own inner turmoil begin to unravel her mental state. The couple is shunned by high society, and Anna, tormented by guilt and jealousy, starts to question Vronsky's loyalty. Her eventual descent into despair and paranoia culminates in one of literature’s most famous tragic endings.</p>
                <p>On the other hand, Levin’s story provides a counterbalance to Anna’s tragic arc. A landowner and intellectual, Levin is searching for deeper meaning in life, struggling with existential questions about faith, love, and his place in Russian society. His love for Kitty, whom he eventually marries, becomes a source of peace and stability. Through Levin’s journey, Tolstoy explores themes of happiness, work, family, and the spiritual aspects of life.</p>

                <ul>
                    <li>
                        <h3>Love and Passion</h3>
                        <p><em>Anna Karenina</em> explores the spectrum of love, from Anna and Vronsky’s passionate but destructive affair to the more stable and enduring love between Levin and Kitty.

                    </li>
                    <li>
                        <h3>Society and Morality</h3>
                        <p>One of the central conflicts of the novel is the clash between individual desires and societal expectations. Anna’s affair with Vronsky defies the moral codes of Russian aristocracy, leading to her ostracism and eventual downfall.

                    </li>
                    <li>

                        <p>The novel presents contrasting views on family.

                        <p>Throughout the novel, Tolstoy weaves in meditations on the meaning of life and the inevitability of death. Levin’s spiritual journey serves as a counterpoint to Anna’s tragic end, suggesting that fulfillment comes from understanding one’s place in the larger order of life.</p>
                    </li>
                    <li>
                        <h3>Faith and Doubt</h3>
                        <p>Through Levin, Tolstoy explores his own existential struggles with religion and faith. Levin’s search for purpose, his doubt about the church, and eventual reconciliation with spirituality provide a philosophical layer to the novel.</p>

                <h2>Conclusion</h2>
                <p><em>Anna Karenina</em> is a rich, multi-layered novel that examines human nature, societal constraints, and the deep complexities of love and relationships. Anna’s tragic downfall and Levin’s spiritual awakening form the emotional and philosophical core of the story, showcasing Tolstoy’s mastery in capturing the intricacies of life. While Anna’s passionate love for Vronsky leads to her self-destruction, Levin’s introspection and embrace of a simpler, more grounded life serve as a contrasting resolution to the human search for meaning.</p>
